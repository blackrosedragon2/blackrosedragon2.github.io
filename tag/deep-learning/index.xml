      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the great success of deep neural networks in a wide range of applications, they have been repeatedly shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial Deep Learning is a book being written by Dr. Di Jin, Dr. Yifang Yin, Yaman Kumar, and Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah, which gives the reader an introduction to the progress made in this field. At code-soup we are building the codebase of these algorithms in a clean, simple and minimal manner . We strive to give the reader a smooth experience while reading the book and understanding the code in parallel with a minimal set of dependencies and library. The website we are creating allows for easy access with comprehensive tutorials to enhance the reading experience in the book.
Code Fencing allows the user to interact with algorithms on the website to get a hands-on experience.&lt;/p&gt;
